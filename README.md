# ASP.NET Core API + Google BigQuery

In this repo I provide an example for ASP.NET Core API + Google BigQuery.

If you do not know about BigQuery:
	- " Google BigQuery is an Enterprise Data Warehouse", according to https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/what-is-bigquery. 
	
Still according to it, you can store and query massive data sets through "super-fast SQL queries with the power of Google's infrastructure processing. Just pass your data to BigQuery, and it will do the hard work. Control access to the project and your data according to the needs of your business, such as granting access to other users to view or query data.
You can access BigQuery using the Web UI or the command line tool or by calling the BigQuery REST API with several client libraries such as Java, .NET, or Python. There are also several third-party tools that you can use to interact with BigQuery to view or load data.
BigQuery is fully managed. To get started, you do not need to deploy any features, such as disks and virtual machines."

You can check more informations on: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/.
